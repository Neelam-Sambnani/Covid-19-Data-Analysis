# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
--------------
This project aims to provide insights into the data from two JSON files related to a specific domain. The JSON files were converted into CSV files and the data was cleaned using Excel and Pandas. Using SQL queries, I was able to extract insights from the data and gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns within it. Finally, I created an interactive dashboard that showcases these insights in a visually appealing way. The dashboard allows users to interact with the data and explore it in a more meaningful way.
----------
The project demonstrates the use of a range of tools and technologies, including Excel, Pandas, SQL, and data visualization libraries. By combining these tools, we were able to extract valuable insights from the data and create an engaging dashboard that presents these insights in a user-friendly manner.
